RadZib Interactive: Your Portal to Post-Apocalyptic Worlds!


Who Are We? RadZib Interactive is a game development studio that creates an innovative AA RPG “Echoes of the Rozlom”.


What We Do? We are developing Echoes of the Rozlom, a post-apocalyptic RPG where players become co-authors of the world through a powerful UGC editor and NFT monetization.


The Coolest Part? The coolest part is that players can not only play, but create unique content and earn money by turning their ideas into real NFT assets through our 'Rozlom Engine' on Solana.


Our Team? Our team consists of two founders who are actively forming partnerships with experienced studios such as Red Viburnum Studio and Max Studio SG to strengthen and accelerate development.


Tech Stack? We use Unreal Engine 5 to develop the game itself and the Solana blockchain to implement a transparent and efficient NFT economy for creators.


Current Status? We have now completed the design phase of Echoes of the Rozlom, are actively developing the game's core on Unreal Engine 5, and are focused on attracting partners to accelerate the project's release.
